# This is Mars

Mars is a command line interface application containing multiple most used functions and scripts. The goal of the app is for you to have access to basic, medium and advanced functions and scripts that are used daily in developer's workflows. This project is developed in Rust as a side hustle and a way to automizing my computer and personal workflow.

Mars is currently supported on Windows for anyone who wants to use it and test it out!
